## Introduction

This vintage Pokedex is a delightful macOS menubar application that brings back the nostalgia of the classic Pokemon games. This project leverages the PokeAPI to provide you with a vintage-style Pokedex experience right on your Mac.

## Features
- **Vintage Design:** Experience the charm of the original Gameboy style with a vintage-inspired user interface.
- **Full listing:** A vintage style, but all modern pokemons are available. Navigate through all generations easily with the progress bar.
- **Detailed Information:** Get comprehensive details about each PokÃ©mon, including types, stats.
- **Shiny:** Shiny management is setup on this project. Will you have the chance to see one ? (Spoiler alert: it is way easier than in the game to catch a shiny).
